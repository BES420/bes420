# 👋 Hi, I’m Eugene

I’m a prompt engineer and tool developer focused on practical AI solutions.

Before working in AI, I spent several years as a **lead engineer in an analytical laboratory**, where I contributed to the development of a **quality management system** and gained deep expertise in **analytical chemistry**.

I’m comfortable with chemical terminology and complex problem-solving — especially in lab workflows, scientific data interpretation, and instrumental methods like **atomic absorption spectroscopy**, **UV-Vis**, and others.

For the past 1.5 years, I’ve worked in customer support and sales, using ChatGPT-like tools daily.  
This experience gave me deep insight into how clients interact with AI and what they expect from it.

To boost my productivity, I started building custom prompt-based tools tailored to my tasks —  
automating responses, improving speed, and integrating product knowledge directly into my flow.  
These tools helped me consistently hit top sales while cutting manual work to a minimum.

Later, I began sharing and adapting these tools for the rest of the team — scaling what started as personal automation into wider internal use.

I enjoy building smart agents that solve real problems — especially tools that make work easier, faster, or more fun.  
Lately, I’ve been exploring computer vision and building systems that extract structured information from raw images (like screenshots or listings).
